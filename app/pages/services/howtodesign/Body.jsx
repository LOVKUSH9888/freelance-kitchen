            <b>DESIGNING A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The key to your success as a food business is in the kitchen design.
            A strong design will make your kitchen run smoothly and efficiently,
            so everything must be planned long before you open your restaurant.
            Everyone knows you need great staff, solid equipment and a chef who
            knows what they are doing but a vital part of your operation is the
            design of your commercial kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The golden triangle myth suggests there are three key factors, but
            the truth is there are five aspects to the optimum kitchen design.
            These are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Storage:</b> Ingredients must be kept fresh and free from
              contamination and at the right temperature depending on the
              product. Utensils must be easily accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Food Preparation:</b> Whether you`re chopping onions or
              poultry, it`s vital to segregate different types of food during
              prep.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Meal Cooking:</b> The cookline is the heart of the kitchen and
              the engine. The location of the cooking equipment is vital to a
              smooth operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Service:</b> Efficient kitchen design means front-of-house
              staff have rapid and safe access to the pass without disrupting
              the kitchen flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cleaning and Washing:</b> Plates, glasses, cutlery etc need to
              be washed ready for re-use. A well designed wash-up that allows
              adequate space for sorting and handling in conjunction with the
              correct dishwasher is vital.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Its around these five stations you must base your kitchen design,
            and its essential that your kitchen flows. Kitchen workers need
            space to move and easy access to most-used points, such as a sink.

          </h3>
          <h5>Spatial Planning</h5>
          <p>
            Smart commercial kitchen design is essential for efficiency, safety,
            and revenue. The first rule of designing a kitchen is to assess the
            following things:
          </p>
          <div className="row">
            <div className="col-9">
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>How much space do I have available?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>What is my intended food offer or menu?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>How many people will I be employing to run the kitchen?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>What is my style of service?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>How many covers am I looking to achieve?</b>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The process of designing the correct facility that meets all of
                your requirements is one that involves the marriage of all these
                things. Normally there is a wish list that you will want to
                achieve but then in most cases, reality kicks in! This is
                normally either spatial restrictions or budget.

            <li>

          <p>
            This is when the delicate balancing act is performed between the
            front of house and the back of house areas. This can involve
            reducing the kitchen footprint by removing equipment, changing the
            sizes of equipment or indeed by changing the operation slightly. It
            can also involve rethinking the style of seating that you are using
            within the restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, food establishments aren`t just a front-of-house dining
            area and a back-of-house kitchen. You must factor in space for staff
            changing rooms and managerial offices, as well as separate areas for
            toilets, chemical storage, waste storage and any other activities
            that may contaminate food or food prep areas.

          <h5>Kitchen Flow</h5>
          <p>
            It`s vitally important to be aware how traffic flows in your
            kitchen. From delivery to cooking to serving to washing, there is a
            process you must plan for. Mapping out your kitchen with these steps
            in mind minimises basic errors, for example your servers having to
            carry dirty plates back through the cooking area and disrupting the
            chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visualising how every aspect of the food service process will play
            out in reality is key to getting things right first time.

            You must also know what food you will be serving beforehand so that
            you buy the necessary catering equipment. Knowing your menu will

            which will save you space as well as money.

                Space permitting, a walk-in cold room is the ideal that most
                chefs and operators require. They allow a lot more storage space
                which can often mean cost savings due to bulk ordering on key
                ingredients. They also allow easier access to goods and produce
                which speeds up operation but also allows easier management of
                use-by dates and product cycles, ensuring that quality of
                product is never in question. In cases where space is limited,
                upright fridges are sometimes the only option.

              <Accordion.Body>
                Again, the preferred choice would be a walk-in freezer store but
                when designing smaller environments this is normally one of the
                luxuries to be sacrificed. Walk-in freezer stores differ from
                cold stores in the fact that they need an insulated floor to
                maintain its optimum temperature. This is achieved by having
                either a raised floor creating a step into the room or by
                creating a recess in the slab so that the finished surface of
                the freezer room can be flush with the surrounding floor
                heights, thus creating the ability to roll in trolleys directly.
                In a lot of cases, freezer storage capacity is created using
                upright standalone cabinets, especially where space is at a
                premium.

                and houses all of the ambient goods that are used whether it`s

                freezer room, when you are designing a smaller environment and
                space is limited, then kitchen wall shelves and cupboards are
                viable options.

                dish-wash area and nowhere near a pre-rinse spray. In larger
                facilities it is advisable to try and incorporate a separate
                crockery store due to a kitchen`s air pollution. In most cases,
                the crockery is redistributed into the pass area, ready to be
                re-used. To minimise movement around the kitchen, crockery
                should ideally be stored near a washing up facility.

                the cooking area to ensure the correct flow is achieved. Where
                possible and when space allows, preparation should be segregated

                <li>
                  <b>Raw meat and fish prep.</b>

                  <b>Prepared or ready cooked prep.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Poultry prep.</b>
                </li>

                  <b>Pastry and dessert prep.</b>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) are increasingly keen on
                segregation. They like to see kitchens divided up into clearly
                defined areas for food prep, and you are advised to contact your
                local EHO so they can inspect your plans/new designs. They can
                offer their views and suggest any changes, such as whether there
                are enough hand sinks, for example. These recommendations can
                prove invaluable to getting your commercial kitchen design right
                first time, saving you money and time in the process.

            If necessary, consider chilled preparation areas for high-risk food
            environments. In smaller establishments where segregation is not
            possible, stringent regimes must be employed to ensure segregation
            of processes, making sure utensils and tables are suitably sanitised
            between processes. In addition, consider adequate refrigerated
            storage for prepared food.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a good idea to always keep the `messy` prep areas away from
            the main cooking area, which is even more important in a theatre
            kitchen where customers have a clear view of back-of-house
            activities. Having as much `put down space for chefs opposite or in
            close proximity to the cooking equipment is really important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst in a kitchen there is a `bulk` stores area, it is vital to
            consider localised refrigeration. A combination of various types of
            under counter refrigeration can be allowed for in the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            These types of fridges are commonly known as `day fridges` and allow
            kitchen staff to take stock up the local refrigerator prior to prep
            starts from the main walk in fridge or freezer.
          </p>
          <p>
            This provides a much smoother and efficient operation which cuts
            down on unnecessary traffic and crossover within the kitchen. In a
            small kitchen, these types of equipment placement are paramount to
            making the space work efficiently.

            <b>Sinks</b>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Prep sinks should be provided in areas such as fish or meat prep
            plus veg prep. It is important to remember that crossover of raw
            product is a major issue and proper segregation of these processes
            should be thought about. As well as preparation sinks there should
            always be a dedicated pot wash sink used solely for this purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            EHO require you to also have dedicated hand wash basins, along with
            adequate soap and hand drying facilities available at key points
            around the kitchen. To summarise key items to incorporate into
            preparation areas:

            <b>Layout Considerations</b>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Plan your workspace dimensions carefully. You`ll need to make
            provisions for space between pieces of equipment, in front of
            equipment including opening doors, as well as factoring in space for
            staff to walk freely around the kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ergonomics: Efficiency is the order of the day when it comes to
            kitchens. Whether it`s a multi-functional machine saving you
            valuable space, or a machine that requires little energy,
            streamlining is important. One area this comes into play is
            minimising the amount of movement staff are required to undertake
            when going about their daily business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Equipment should be strategically placed so that staff can take as
            few steps as possible, with minimal bending, reaching, walking or
            turning. For example, a salamander grill should be near your main
            oven range, and your fridge, freezer and blast chiller should be
            close together for fast access to refrigeration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating an energy-efficient kitchen saves you money. Refrigeration
            and cooking equipment should be kept apart to save your
            refrigeration unit from overworking. Cooking equipment should also
            be strategically placed to promote the ventilation hoods`
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be flexible. In the food industry, trends change quickly and what`s
            working today might not work tomorrow. Perhaps your chef moves on
            and the new one wants to change the menu you want a design that can
            accommodate different styles easily. Include quick disconnects for
            your gas cooking equipment for optimum mobility and easy cleaning.
          </p>
          <h5>
            <b>Design Layout Options</b>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Island-style: An island-style kitchen features one main block in the
            middle of the main space. Usually the cooking equipment is in the
            middle, with food prep, storage and kitchen-to-serve transition
            areas on the outer walls. Sometimes this is reversed, with prep
            equipment in the centre and cooking equipment found at the
            perimeter.

        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-9">
          <p>
            Zone-style: In a zone-style layout the kitchen is divided into
            different sections. There are sections for food prep, for cooking,
            for refrigeration and ice machines, for sanitation and ware washing
            as well as a section for kitchen-to-server transition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Assembly-line: This is ideal for restaurants producing large
            quantities of the same food, such as pizza places or sandwich shops.
            The kitchen is laid out in order of use and equipment is set up in a
            line, creating a conveyor belt-style operation. A pizza shop, for
            example, can start with the refrigerator, moving to the
            dough-shaping area, to the pizza prep table, then to the gas deck
            oven, and eventually the warming and holding station or into a pizza
            box.
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing what you all be serving and having a clear idea for what you
            want your business to be will help you decide which layout is best
            for you.

            Kitchens can get incredibly hot, and to keep staff safe as well as
            comfortable, heat must be reduced. Include extraction and
            ventilation systems above combi ovens, fryers and all gas appliances
            to remove excess hot air and freshen up your kitchen.

            All cooking equipment should be under a suitably ventilated canopy
            with appropriate overhangs to all sides. Canopies should have
            removable and washable filters to alleviate grease and particle
            build up. It is also advised that, in particularly greasy
            environments, carbon and grease filters be placed in the ductwork
            also. Extraction systems need to be calculated on the cooking
            equipment beneath it, especially when gas equipment is involved.

          <p>
            Access panels to all parts of the ductwork is also required for

            Having a kitchen which is easy to clean is essential. A dirty
            kitchen will not just run the risk of breaching hygiene laws, but it
            will also impact on the performance of your equipment leading to
            wear-and-tear and eventual need for replacements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surfaces which will come into contact with food must not absorb
            grease, food particles or water. Stainless steel is the optimum
            material here, as it is durable and can withstand chemicals for easy
            cleaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iron and mild steel is not suitable for use in a kitchen. Generally,
            nor is timber. Plastic laminate and solid surface materials are
            suitable surfaces for food preparation. All surfaces should be
            non-porous (meaning liquid or air cannot pass through) and must be
            replaced when scratched or damaged.

            Waste management is key to a hygienic operation. Waste that needs to
            be disposed of includes food wastage, grease, general rubbish and
            recyclables. Examples of food wastage include unsafe, unsuitable,
            recalled/returned, out-of-date and previously served food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waste facilities should be located at the food prep area, and near

          </p>
          <p>
            These waste facilities are usually bins with lids lined with green
            bio-degradable bags. Bins must be easily accessed in all areas of
            the kitchen and be fitted with a secure lid.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a room is used for waste collection, it should be away from food
            storage and prep areas due to risk of contamination. Recyclable
            materials such as bottles and cans are usually put into bins or
            crates in the kitchen and then moved to outdoor bins or a separate
            room for collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any rubbish chutes should be made of stainless steel. Empty grease
            traps and arrestors should be emptied by a qualified person
            regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waste containers should be stainless steel, due to its durability,
            and clearly identified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waste storage containers must be kept separately away from food
            locations, with suitable ventilation and free from pests. You should
            ensure that water from cleaning exits through a drain into a grease
            trap and doesnot mix with other areas.

          The necessity for good lighting in your kitchen is obvious. However
          there are many things to consider to make sure you have right level of
          light; for example, your kitchen should be free from glare and
          reflections. You will also need to make sure you choose the right bulb.
        </p>

      <div className="row">
        <div className="col-8">
          <p>
            Consider: Natural light, required luminance levels (lux), surface
            reflections, emergency lighting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The clear benefit of natural light is cost and efficiency, however
            as your kitchen will almost certainly be used late into the night,
            your main source of light will be artificial. Windows in the kitchen
            should preferably be less than 10 per cent of the total floor area,
            looking out to the sky or open spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Give careful consideration to the positioning of windows and
            skylights to minimise glare. The recommended illuminance level for a
            commercial kitchens general working area is 160 lux. For food
            preparation, cooking and washing areas the luminance should be 240
            lux. Dessert presentations and cake decorating require 400-800 lux.
          </p>
          <p>
            Light reflects off walls, ceilings, floors and surfaces. Colour,
            material and finish of these surfaces needs to be thought about, as
            the reflectance can be a factor in the luminance level of the area.
            Good visibility is paramount to a smooth-running kitchen.

            Emergency lighting must be included to ensure patrons and staff will
            be safely evacuated if the situation calls for it. Emergency
            lighting turns on automatically from its own power supply whenever
            there is a power failure.

            <b>Walls</b>
          </h6>
          <p>
            Wall finishes must be resistant to grease, food particles and water.
            It must be smooth and even, with no exposed fixings, buckles or
            ledges. As hygiene is vital to a commercial kitchen, the wall
            surfaces must also be easy to clean.
          </p>
          <p>Things to consider:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Ceramic tiles with anti-bacterial grout.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>
                Maintain a minimum 1200mm wide free-draining paved surface
                around the premises.
              </b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Install fly screens where windows can be opened.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cover external vents with mesh.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>CSeal the junctions of external walls and roofs.</b>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To ensure storage areas are free from pests you should inspect stock
            daily, exercise regular rotation of stock, as well as making sure
            store room racks are 600mm from the walls for easy cleaning and
            inspection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Invest in insect control devices such as electronic insect killers
            placed at entrances to tackle the problem as it arrives. A filter
            should be fitted to ensure flies and insects donot enter the kitchen
            through ventilation.
          </p>

            <b>Flooring</b>
          </h6>
          <p>
            When considering surfaces for your kitchen floor, you must choose
            materials which have a non-slip surface. Appropriate surfaces
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Stainless steel with a non-slip profile and welded joints.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ceramic tiles with epoxy grouting.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Steel trowel case hardened concrete with epoxy sealant.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Quarry tiles with impervious sealer.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Polyvinyl sheet or tiles with heat welded joints.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Its important to remember that the junction of floor and wall
            surfaces can be a hot bed for contamination due to grease and dirt.
            Consider coving the junction to make it easier to clean.
