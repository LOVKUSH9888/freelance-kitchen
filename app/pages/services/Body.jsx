            <b>DESIGNING A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN</b>
          </h3>
          <p>
            The key to your success as a food business is in the kitchen design.
            A strong design will make your kitchen run smoothly and efficiently,
            so everything must be planned long before you open your restaurant.
            Everyone knows you need great staff, solid equipment and a chef who
            knows what they're doing – but a vital part of your operation is the
            design of your commercial kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The golden triangle myth suggests there are three key factors, but
            the truth is there are five aspects to the optimum kitchen design.
            These are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Storage:</b> Ingredients must be kept fresh and free from
              contamination and at the right temperature depending on the
              product. Utensils must be easily accessible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Food Preparation:</b> Whether you’re chopping onions or
              poultry, it’s vital to segregate different types of food during
              prep.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Meal Cooking:</b> The cookline is the heart of the kitchen and
              the engine. The location of the cooking equipment is vital to a
              smooth operation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Service:</b> Efficient kitchen design means front-of-house
              staff have rapid and safe access to the pass without disrupting
              the kitchen flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Cleaning and Washing:</b> Plates, glasses, cutlery etc need to
              be washed ready for re-use. A well designed wash-up that allows
              adequate space for sorting and handling in conjunction with the
              correct dishwasher is vital.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            It's around these five stations you must base your kitchen design,
            and it's essential that your kitchen flows. Kitchen workers need
            space to move and easy access to most-used points, such as a sink.

            <b>SPATIAL PLANNING, DELIVERY AND STORAGE</b>
          </h3>
          <h5>Spatial Planning</h5>
          <p>
            Smart commercial kitchen design is essential for efficiency, safety,
            and revenue. The first rule of designing a kitchen is to assess the
            following things:
          </p>
          <div className="row">
            <div className="col-9">
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <b>How much space do I have available?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>What is my intended food offer or menu?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>How many people will I be employing to run the kitchen?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>What is my style of service?</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>How many covers am I looking to achieve?</b>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                The process of designing the correct facility that meets all of
                your requirements is one that involves the marriage of all these
                things. Normally there is a wish list that you will want to
                achieve but then in most cases, reality kicks in! This is
                normally either spatial restrictions or budget.

          <p>In simple terms the process works like this:</p>

              <b>
                The menu dictates the catering equipment and processes required.

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>
                The staffing numbers dictate the working and circulation space.

              <b>
                The resulting size of the kitchen dictates the front of house

          <p>
            This is when the delicate balancing act is performed between the
            front of house and the back of house areas. This can involve
            reducing the kitchen footprint by removing equipment, changing the
            sizes of equipment or indeed by changing the operation slightly. It
            can also involve rethinking the style of seating that you are using
            within the restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, food establishments aren’t just a front-of-house dining
            area and a back-of-house kitchen. You must factor in space for staff
            changing rooms and managerial offices, as well as separate areas for
            toilets, chemical storage, waste storage and any other activities
            that may contaminate food or food prep areas.

          <h5>Kitchen Flow</h5>
          <p>
            It’s vitally important to be aware how traffic flows in your
            kitchen. From delivery to cooking to serving to washing, there is a
            process you must plan for. Mapping out your kitchen with these steps
            in mind minimises basic errors, for example your servers having to
            carry dirty plates back through the cooking area and disrupting the
            chefs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visualising how every aspect of the food service process will play
            out in reality is key to getting things right first time.

                Baskets are then left to air dry on basket runners or placed

            You must also know what food you will be serving beforehand so that
            you buy the necessary catering equipment. Knowing your menu will

            which will save you space as well as money.

                Space permitting, a walk-in cold room is the ideal that most
                chefs and operators require. They allow a lot more storage space
                which can often mean cost savings due to bulk ordering on key
                ingredients. They also allow easier access to goods and produce
                which speeds up operation but also allows easier management of
                use-by dates and product cycles, ensuring that quality of
                product is never in question. In cases where space is limited,
                upright fridges are sometimes the only option.

              <Accordion.Body>
                Again, the preferred choice would be a walk-in freezer store but
                when designing smaller environments this is normally one of the
                luxuries to be sacrificed. Walk-in freezer stores differ from
                cold stores in the fact that they need an insulated floor to
                maintain its optimum temperature. This is achieved by having
                either a raised floor creating a step into the room or by
                creating a recess in the slab so that the finished surface of
                the freezer room can be flush with the surrounding floor
                heights, thus creating the ability to roll in trolleys directly.
                In a lot of cases, freezer storage capacity is created using
                upright standalone cabinets, especially where space is at a
                premium.

                and houses all of the ambient goods that are used – whether it’s
                tinned or canned goods, spices or fresh produce. Similar to the
                freezer room, when you are designing a smaller environment and
                space is limited, then kitchen wall shelves and cupboards are
                viable options.

                an area that is clean and free from grease, water and dirty
                items. It’s normally located near to the exit table of the
                dish-wash area and nowhere near a pre-rinse spray. In larger
                facilities it is advisable to try and incorporate a separate
                crockery store due to a kitchen’s air pollution. In most cases,
                the crockery is redistributed into the pass area, ready to be
                re-used. To minimise movement around the kitchen, crockery
                should ideally be stored near a washing up facility.
